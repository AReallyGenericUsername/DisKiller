# DisKiller
A neat little command line tool thing which I made to nuke discord servers.

Has 12 (technically 13) attack options for screwing around.
Still has some debugging code in it so expect some spam in some of the functions. 

    1 -> Spam @Everyone Everywhere                         
    2 -> Ban Everyone 
    3 -> Kick Everyone             
    4 -> Create Channel Flood      
    5 -> Delete All Channels         
    6 -> Replace All Channels (4+5 combined)      
    7 -> Role Flood                                
    8 -> Delete All Roles                     
    9 -> Rename All Roles                         
    10 -> Nickname Everyone                     
    11 -> DM Everyone                            
    12 -> Nuclear Option (comes in two flavors)
